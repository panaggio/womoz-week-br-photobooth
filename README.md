# Maker Party Week Photobooth!

This web app was created for [Maker Party Week SÃ£o Paulo](http://blog.mozillabrasil.org.br/i-maker-party-week-sao-paulo/). I've created this web app based on [Marcus Saad's Launchparty Phootobooth](http://marcussaad.github.io/launchparty-photobooth/), which was based on [Christian Heilmann's Interaction Cam](http://codepo8.github.com/interaction-cam/).

## Usage

Design is simplistic and functional (not really, but I did my best).

* Click on the Camera Icon (Yes, it was borrowed from Firefox OS intentionally)
* Before taking a picture, customize your Adjective by selecting a new one on the dropdown.
* You'll need to use timers to take a picture, they are set to shoot on 3, 5 or 10 seconds.
* You may try again if the result doesn't meet your needs.
* If you're good to go, go ahead and click on Share This! Your image will be uploaded to imgur. As soon as the callback is made, click on the Twitter Icon to share it using your credentials.

## Image uploading

The image uploading is using the [CORS anonymous API of imgur](http://api.imgur.com/#anonapi) for storing pictures. The original code was used in the [Motivational Poster Generator](https://github.com/paulrouget/motivational) which used to be part of the Mozilla Web'o'Wonder.

If you use this, please [get your own Application Key](https://imgur.com/register/api_anon) as the API is limited to 50 images per hour!
